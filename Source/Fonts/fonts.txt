Font files for ROMWBW.

8x8: 8x8 cell, mostly IBM CGA, first 16 differ, thin font
8x11: 8x11 cell, possibly VT-100?
8x16: 8x16 cell, IBM MDA
CGA: 8x16 cell, IBM CGA, normal (thick) CGA font, rows 8-15 are unused padding

There are multiple fonts associated with ROMWBW supported hardware:

	Board		Driver		Chip
	--------	--------	--------
	ECB-SCG		tms.asm		9918
	ECB-VDU		vdu.asm		6545
	ECB-CVDU	cvdu.asm	8563
	ECB-VGA3	vga.asm		6445
	MBC-VDC		cvdu.asm	8568
	MBC-VDP		tms.asm		9938/9958

Notes:

- The CGA font is roughly equivalent to the 8x8 font, but padded out to 8x16.  Scan lines
  8-15 are unused.  The CVDU driver (8563 chip) always uses fonts defined in an 8x16 cell.
  When the CVDU is configured for use with a CGA monitor, an 8x8 character cell is used,
  but the font definition must still be 8x16.  The CGA font is used for this.

For inclusion in HBIOS the .bin format files must be converted to assembler .asm format.
This is acheived using the fonttool utility and is completed automatically as part of the build process.
i.e. fonts files are converted to .asm format and then copied to the HBIOS directory. 

To replace a font, simply copy it to the Fonts directory using the same naming convention above, 
ensuring format and size match. Then complete a new build process.

To reduce the size of the HBIOS image, fonts can be compressed by using the USEZLSA2 equate.

Use the following in your custom configuration to turn on font compression:

USELZSA2	.SET	TRUE 

Compressed fonts are created using lzsa utility.

During the build process, fonts are compressed using the command line compressor by Emmanuel Marty
The compression is done as follows:

lzsa.exe -f2 -r <sourcefile> <outfile>

where option -f2 selects lzsa version 2 compression.
where option -r asks for the generation of raw (frame-less) data.
