In general, the BPBIOS for RomWBW is incomplete.  This is
mostly just a proof of concept that it can work.  As such,
it is not built or included in the default builds of
RomWBW.  You *must* review and adjust the file romwbw.lib
before building BPBIOS.  To include BPBIOS in the build
process, you need to uncomment the corresponding line
in the Build.cmd file in the Source directory.

For now, BPBIOS does not understand the dynamic disk assignment
mechanism of RomWBW.  This means that you need to explicitly
tell BPBIOS the console unit number and the disk unit number of
the first hard disk device.  Floppy drives are basically not
supported.  You should review and adjust the romwbw.lib file
as needed.  The RomWBW ASSIGN command is not supported.  BPBIOS
will boot from the first hard disk unit number you assign and
always from the first slice.

BPBIOS does not yet understand the 1024 directory entry
hard disk format.  You must use the 512 directory entry
format images.
