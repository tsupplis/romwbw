INTTEST
=======

RomWBW includes an API allowing applications to "hook" interrupts.
The `INTTEST` utility allows you to test this functionality.


** Syntax **

`INTTEST`


** Usage **

`INTTEST` is an interactive application.  At startup, it will display
a list of the interrupt vector slots in your system along with the
current vector address for each of them.

It then prompts you to enter the slot number (in hex) of a vector to
hook.  After entering this, the application will watch the hooked
vector and countdown from 0xFF to 0x00 as interrupts are noted.

When the counter reaches 0x00, the interrupt is unhooked and the
application terminates.  The application can also be terminated by
pressing <esc>.


** Notes **

If your system is running without interrupts active, the application
will terminate immediately.

All slots have vectors even if the corresponding interrupt is not
doing anything.  In this case, the vector is pointing to the "bad
interrupt" handler.

If you hook a vector that is not receiving any interrupts, the
down-counter will not do anything.


** Etymology* *

The `INTTEST` command is an original product and the source code is
provided in the RomWBW distribution.
