XModem 12.5 & Tera Term Anomaly Analysis
----------------------------------------

Protocol Notes:

- During protocol startup, the receiver NAKs the sender repeatedly
  to let the sender know it can start sending.
- Normally, the receiver sends a NAK character to ask the sender to
  resend a packet.
- Prior to receiving the first packet, the receiver may send a "C"
  or a "CK" instead of a NAK.  This mechanism is used to inform the
  sender that the receiver wants to use (C)RC error detection 
  instead of checksum error detection and optionally 1(K) packet sizes.
- After the first packet exchange, a NAK is always used to
  request a packet be resent.
  
Anomalous Exchange Description:

XModem on RomWBW is being used to receive a file being sent
by Tera Term on a Windows PC...

- XModem is started in receive mode
- User starts process of selecting a file to send on Tera Term
- XModem begins sending "CK" sequences as described above
  to wake up the sender
- Tera Term buffers incoming "CK" sequences while user is selecting
  a file to send
- User completes file selection
- Tera Term receives the first "CK" which was buffered while user
  was selecting a file
- Tera Term correctly receives the first "CK", sets itself to
  use CRC and 1K packets, then sends the first packet
- While waiting for Tera Term to send the first packet, XModem
  is repeatedly timing out and resending the "CK" sequence
- For each timeout, XModem spends 1 second flushing any incoming
  characters from the sender (it assumes it is flushing line garbage).
- IFF the first packet from Tera Term starts to arrive during this
  1 second flushing interval, XModem gobbles up and discards the
  first packet sent by Tera Term
- XModem then sends a new "CK" because it is still waiting for the
  first packet (having just flushed the actual first packet)
- Tera Term has already switched out of "first packet" mode and will
  now only respond to an actual NAK character, so it ignores all of
  the CKs send from XModem
- XModem continues to send CKs and Tera Term continues to ignore them
  until XModem hits a retry threshold
- When XModem hits the retry threshold, it attempts to switch from
  CRC to Checksum assuming the sender was not capable of using
  CRCs
- XModem now sends a NAK character because that is what is used for
  for first packet NAKing in Checksum mode
- Tera Term sees the NAK and resends the first packet, but appends a
  CRC instead of a Checksum because Tera Term is still in CRC mode
- XModem fails the Tera Term first packet resends because it is
  looking for a Checksum and Tera Term is appending CRCs.
- XModem eventually gives up.

Summary of failure:

If Tera Term happens to start sending the first packet during the
one second "flush" window of XModem, the exchange will fail during
the startup sequence.

Since the precise start timing of the first packet is dependent on
the time the user takes to select a file, the occurrence of the
failure is essentially random.

The timeout used by XModem is about 5 seconds followed by the 1
second line flush.  So, there is a 1 in 6 chance that the protocol
will fail to startup successfully.

Mitigation:

- Modified the receive timeout recovery to *not* flush the incoming
  buffer for one second.  Flushing in this scenario makes no sense
  anyway because a timeout just occurred meaning no data is being
  received.
