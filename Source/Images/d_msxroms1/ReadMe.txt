===== MSX ROMs Disk for RomWBW =====

This is disk 1 of 2 of the collection of MSX ROMs as provided by Les 
Bird (ROM filenames A-K).  These ROMs are "run" by using the 
appropriate variant of Les' MSX8 ROM loader.  You can download the 
loader binaries from https://github.com/lesbird/MSX8.  You will need
appropriate hardware to run the loader.

Please review the file ROMLIST.TXT for information on the current
operational status of the ROM and it's long file name/description.

This disk (RomWBW slice) is not automatically included with the
RomWBW "combo" disk images.  You can simply add it to a combo
image by appending it to the end.  After booting your system,
you can use the ASSIGN command to map the slice to a drive letter.
Refer to the RomWBW User Guide for more information on this
process.
