======================================

===== Z80ASM v1.30 by SLR Systems =====

Z80ASM is a relocating macro assembler for CP/M. It takes assembly language
source statements from a disk file, converts them into their binary equivalent,
and stores the output in either a core-image, Intel hex format, or relocatable
object file. The mnemonics recognized are those of Zilog/Mostek. The optional
listing output may be sent to a disk file, the console and/or the printer, in
any combination. Output files may also be generated containing cross-reference
information on each symbol used.

===== SLR180 v1.31 by SLR Systems =====

SLR180 is a powerful relocating macro assembler for Z80
compatible CP/M systems. It takes assembly language source
statements from a disk file, converts them into their binary
equivalent, and stores the output in either a core-image, Intel
hex format, or relocatable object file. The mnemonics recognized
are those of Zilog/Hitachi. The optional listing output may be
sent to a disk file, the console and/or the printer, in any
combination. Output files may also be generated containing
cross-reference information on each symbol used.

===== MAKESYM SuperLinker v1.31 =====

MAKESYM is a utility to create symbol SYM table files

===== SLRNK SuperLinker v1.31 =====

SLRNK is a powerful linking loader for Z80-based CP/M systems.
It takes relocatable binary information in either Microsoft or
SLR Systems format from a disk file, resolves external and entry
point references, and stores the output in memory for execution
or outputs it to a disk file.

===== SLRIB SuperLibrarian v1.30 =====

Library Manager

===== Z80DIS Disassembler v2.2 =====

Z80DIS  is a disassembler for Z80 based CP/M systems.  Z80DIS  is
designed  to  generate  Z80 mnemonics  and  prepare  an  assembly
language   file   with   many  special  features  for   ease   of
understanding the intent of the disassembled code. The source for
Z80DIS has grown to 8400 lines of pascal code.
