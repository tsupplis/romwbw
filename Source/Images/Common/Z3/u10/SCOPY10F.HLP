:1

C  Copy - Send file at pointer to  other directory.  An arrow  at 
   the  top of the screen shows the copy direction.   Copying  is 
   controlled by verification flags described below.  If there is 
   inadequate  space  on the destination disk, the  copy  is  not 
   attempted, and (for Group operations) the file remains tagged.

D  Delete - Delete file at pointer.

M  Move - Copy, then delete source file.

R  Rename
   Rename does not integrate too well with SCOPY's method of file    
   display.   In fact, the display may become useless.  Therefore 
   SCOPY requires a Relog before any copy operations are  allowed 
   following a Rename.

   If an Archived file is renamed, the archive attribute is reset.  
   (Ditto the Public attribute.)

Q  Quick Copy - Copy current file to  alternate directory.  Saves 
   you the trouble of logging in the alternate  directory.  Quick 
   Copy  bypasses any checks against the destination date   stamp 
   or  disk  capacity.  It is fast, but you don't  get  the  full 
   benefit of Login.


K  Kompare  -  Do  a  byte for  byte  comparison  of  source  and 
   destination files, report the result on the screen divider  as 
   "="  or "~". For Group Kompare, you may then retag files which
   tested either equal or unequal. 


S  Set  Attributes - Set or clear F1, F3, F4, W/P, R/O, SYS,  and 
   ARC attributes in any combination:
     Set: 1,3,4,W,R,S,A  Clear: -1,-3,-4,-W,-R,-S,-A
:2

JUMP COMMANDS:

J  Jump - Find the next match  to the mask entered.  The mask  is              
   automatically wildcarded.

^J, H ReJump - Use the same mask.  (^J will not work if your TCAP 
   defines it as an arrow key.  Use H (Hop) instead.)

1  Jump  One  -  Go to next file which  exists  only  in  current 
   directory. 

2  Jump Two - Go to next file which exists in both directories.

`  Jump Tagged - Go to next tagged file.

~  Jump Untagged - Go to next untagged file.
:3

T  Tag - Mark a file for a Group operation.  Group Tag tags all files 
   from the pointer to the end of the list.

U  Untag - Cancels a tag.  Group Untag untags all files from the 
   pointer to the end of the list.

Y  Retag - When a Group operation  runs through the  tagged  file 
   list, the files are "soft" tagged.  This command retags them.

GR Group Reverse - Reverses the tags on all files.

WILD COMMAND

   (W)ild Tag/ Untag/ New/ 1/ 2  MASK  DATESPEC

   Select  a  fileset  for a Group  operation  by  comparing  the 
   directory  to a Mask and/or Datespec, and:

       1.  (T)ag all matches
       2.  (U)ntag all matches
       3.  (N)ew - Tag match only if the source version is Newer.
       4.  (1) -Tag match if it exists in 1 directory only.
       5.  (2) -Tag match if it exists in 2 directories. 
       
           "Newness"  is  determined by  comparing  the  two 
           Modify dates if possible.  If there is no  Modify 
           date  for  one of the files, its Create  date  is 
           used.   If  neither  is valid, the  file  is  not 
           tagged.   The command has no effect on  unstamped 
           disks  or systems.  Note that one  file's  Modify 
           date could be compared to the other file's Create 
           date (if it has no Modify date.)


   Wild   commands  ask  for  an  optional  Mask   (automatically 
   wildcarded)  and  an  optional  Datespec.   The  datespec   is 
   compared  to  the Modify  date or,  if there is  none, to  the 
   Create date.  Access date is not used. 

   The datespec format is:

          [/C]<, >, or =date[ time]

       Where:
          /C     Forces comparison to Create date ONLY
          < > =  Mandatory date signifier (how to use date)
          date   dd.mm.yy  (any part omitted = the current date)
          date   mm/dd/yy  (alternate format)
          time   hh:mm     (any part omitted is ignored)

       Wildcard characters "?" or "*" are allowed in date, time.

       Examples:
          <1.9        Selects all modified before 1 Sept this year
          =           All modified today
          >.. 13:00   All modified after 1pm today
          /c=*        All created any day this month

   European  style date format is the default if the date  parser 
   is  unable to determine which one you are using. "xx" will  be 
   taken to mean "dd". "xx/" means "mm".

   Some mask and/or date spec must be given, or the Wild  command 
   cancels.  You can use a single "." or "*" to test everything.

       WILD Examples:

       WN.
       Tag  everything in the source dir newer than  an  existing 
       file in the destination. 

       W2=
       Tag all files modified today in the source directory which 
       also exist in the destination directory.
   
       WTs /c>.. 10
       Tag all S*.* created after 10AM today.

V - View

   The  main viewer commands are shown highlighted on the  bottom 
   screen  line.   All viewer functions are controlled  with  the 
   left hand.  These are:

       F - Next screen
       A - Previous screen
       T - Top screen
       B - Bottom screen
       R - Read more file if too big for available buffer
       G - GoTo string up to 20 characters.  "?" is wild char.
       H - Repeat GoTo on same string.  Same as G<cr>
       X - Done with this file.  Group View goes on to next file.
       S - Scroll continuously forward until a keypress
       D - Reverse scroll.

   Commands NOT shown while viewing are:

       <sp>  Next line
          -  Previous line
       <cr>  Next screen (synonym for Forward)
       <tab> Hop forward 10 lines
       ^C    Abort loop (Group View)

GROUP COMMANDS:

Group commands operate on tagged files, proceeding from file to 
file.  To cancel a group operation, press ^C.


GA Archive - Copy only tagged files which do NOT have the archive 
   attribute set, then set the source archive attribute.

GC Copy         Automates single file command.
GD Delete
GM Move
GV View
GK Kompare      May retag all equal or unequal files after comparison.
GQ Quick
GS Set Attributes
:6

GE - Group Equate

Copy all tagged files which do not exist in the destination 
directory, OR whose datestamp (including the time) is different 
from the target file datestamp.  Group Equate is equivalent to 
copying every tagged file from the source to the destination, but 
it does not waste time copying files which are presumably the 
same.  (The files may not actually BE the same in the case of a 
copy  error, bad  disk sector, faulty clock, etc.  If you  
suspect  you can't trust the datestamps, use GC - Group Copy.)

Group Equate insists that both Create and Modify fields of the 
datestamp be identical.  The dates are not  checked for validity, 
however.  (A file does not _have_ to have a valid Modify date.) 
If both files have null datestamps, GE will untag.

     ...more


GN - Group New

Copy all tagged files which do not exist in the destination, OR 
whose datestamp is newer than the target file datestamp.  This 
command UPDATES the destination.

If any dates aren't valid, then a file flunks this test and is 
untagged.

  Summary:

       GROUP  EQUATE is intended for restoring a  directory  from 
       older backup files.  GROUP NEW is for updating a directory 
       with  newer  files.  WILD selects a file set by  name  and 
       date criteria for the Group commands to act on.

Note that cursor commands are available to jump to the next  FILE 
in  the current window (<SP>) or to the next LINE of the  display 
(^X).  The directory displays are interleaved, so there could  be 
many blank lines in one directory between files entries.

O - Options Menu

Datestamp Oriented Options:

     A. replace by date      If Yes, D-F are ignored, else B-C ignored
     B. older replace query
     C. newer/equal replace query  If No query, copy is NOT made.

   Use these options if A. is NO, or the file datestamp is invalid.
     D. single replace query
     E. group replace query
     F. archive replace query

A. Replace by Date - If Yes, the next two options are  operative.  
   If No, they are ignored.  Quick Copy ignores Replace by Date.

B. Older Replace - Ask before replacing an older file.

C. Newer/ Equal Replace - Ask before replacing a newer file.  You 
   usually  won't want to.  Therefore, if this option is  set  to 
   NO, the copy does NOT occur.




If the dates compared aren't valid, then date replace  queries 
are  skipped and fall back on options D-F.  SCOPY  would  then 
work like ZFILER for systems/disks without datestamps.

********
   HINT:   Set  up SCOPY's query options to allow you  to  safely 
   play with the new date selection methods.  You will be able to 
   see  on screen what SCOPY intends to do, but can bail  out  at 
   the  prompt  before anything happens.  The easiest way  to  do 
   this is to Ask For Verification.  A ^C at the Y/N prompt  will 
   cancel the command.  Files will remain tagged.
********

     ...more

G. Verify Query - Ask whether or not to do CRC verification.

H. Verify Default - If not queried, do CRC verification?

I. Supress SYS Files - Only takes effect when logging in.

J. Set  Copied File Attributes - Destination file attributes  are 
   cleared unless this option is Yes.

K. Use Destination Attributes - IF previous option is Yes, use  
   existing destination attributes on copy, else use source.

L. Archive Destination - Used when copying files to a work  area, 
   such  as  a  RAM disk.  The Group  Archive  command  can  then 
   conveniently  move  any files you altered  back  to  permanent 
   storage when you are done.

M. Show  File  Attributes - SCOPY uses the extended  TCAP  SETATR 
   function to underline filename characters to represent a  file 
   attribute  set.  This is unobtrusive,  but doesn't  give  good
   results on all terminals.  SCOPY can be configured to show set
   attributes in upper case, or you can just turn the display off.
:9
L  Login  -  Relog SCOPY with new command line,  using  the  same 
   syntax  as on initial callup.  As a convenience, the  ":"   is 
   optional  following  a DIR reference.  Note that if you   name  
   only   one directory, the current directory is assumed  to  be 
   the   source,  and  it is the other directory  which  changes.  
   Login does not preserve the old file mask.

N  New DIR - Change the current directory only, same mask.

<ESC>  Relog  - Logs the same directories with the same file mask 
   You  may  want  to  Relog after  renaming  files,  after  file 
   deletions  have  left  big holes in the file   list,  or  when 
   changing floppy disks during a backup operation.

TAB - Switch copy direction.

Z - Command line.  Run a Z-System command, and reinvoke SCOPY when
    done.  The command is run from the original DU: in which SCOPY
    was invoked. (This function requires an XFCB and User Reg 21.)


IMPORTANT NOTE:  SCOPY requires an extended TCAP 4D which includes
   Insert/Delete line, and Clear to End of Screen.   If available,
   it uses cursor on/off, line graphics, and character attributes.
