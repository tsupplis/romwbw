   Screen Copy is a  screen-oriented file copy utility for  ZCPR3 and  Z3PLUS.
It displays both the source and  destination  directories in  vertical windows
and uses copy commands much like ZFILER's.   It also has extensive support for
file datestamping with commands to select and copy files by  date.   It is not
intended to be a comprehensive file-management tool like ZFILER or DATSWEEP.

   SCOPY requires an  extended  TCAP and  will not  work without Insert/Delete
Line and Clear to End of Screen.  It also makes optional use of cursor on/off,
line graphics,  and character  attributes  (to underline a file name character
with its attribute set.)

 Syntax   SCOPY <source or destination dir:>[mask] [dest dir:]

   If only one DIR is given,  it is the target  directory,  and the  currently
logged DIR is the source directory.   If two directories are given, the source
is the first one.  The optional MASK is automatically wildcarded. 

   Example:  These three are equivalent --

   ( source:  work:       B0:WORK>scopy backup:x.c      or,
destination:  backup:     B0:WORK>scopy x.c backup:     or,
       mask:  x*.c?? )    B0:WORK>scopy work:x.c backup:

                          B0:SCOPY X     --> Error: Scr=Dest

   File operations are  bi-directional,  so it  doesn't  matter  which  is the
master and which is the target directory.

   When re-logging from  within  SCOPY,  the  syntax has the same meaning, but
remember that you will not  necessarily be  currently  logged  into  the  same
directory as at startup.

 SCOPY Notes  

   a. Z3PLUS Users:  This  version of  SCOPY does copy file datestamps.  
      Also copies datestamps under ZSDOS/ZDDOS and DateStamper.
      
   b. HINT:  Set up SCOPY's query options to allow you to safely play with the
      new date selection methods.   You will be  able  to see  on  screen what
      SCOPY intends to do, but can bail out  at  the  prompt  before  anything
      happens.  The easiest way to do this is to  Ask For Verification.   A ^C
      at the Y/N prompt will cancel the command.
