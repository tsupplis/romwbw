ZZRCC has no real ROM.  It has a single 512K RAM chip.  The first
256K of the RAM chip is loaded from the CF card.  This 256K is
treated like ROM by RomWBW.  The remainder of the RAM (256K) is
treated like RAM by RomWBW.

Because of the memory constraints, notice that there is no RAM Disk,
only a ROM disk.  If you perform a ROM boot to an OS, the A: drive
will be the ROM disk and will not be writable.  Booting a ROM OS
on this system is not typical since the system has a CF card by
definition.
