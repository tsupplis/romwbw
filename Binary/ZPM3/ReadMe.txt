This directory contains the ZPM3 system files for the RomWBW ZPM3
adaptation.  All of these files are already included on the ZPM3
boot disk images.  However if you are creating a CP/M 3 boot disk
manually, you should copy all of these files to the boot disk.

These files should also be copied to any ZPM3 boot disks on your
system when you upgrade your ROM firmware.  Some of these files
*must* match the version of the RomWBW firmware you are using for
proper operation of your system.
