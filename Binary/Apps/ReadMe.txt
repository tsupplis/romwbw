This directory contains the executable application files that
are specific to RomWBW.  The source for these applications is found
in the Source\Apps directory of the distribution.

The Tunes subdirectory contains some sample ProTracker and MYM sound
files that can be played by the TUNE application.

All of these files are already included in the pre-built boot disk
images.  They are also included on the ROM disk except for
FAT.COM, TUNE.COM, and the sample tune files in the Tunes directory.

If you upgrade your ROM to a new version, you should also copy
these files over to any hard disk images you are using.
