This directory contains the CP/M 3 system files for the RomWBW CP/M 3
adaptation.  All of these files are already included on the CP/M 3
boot disk images.  However if you are creating a CP/M 3 boot disk
manually, you should copy all of these files to the boot disk.

These files should also be copied to any CP/M 3 boot disks on your
system when you upgrade your ROM firmware.  Some of these files
*must* match the version of the RomWBW firmware you are using for
proper operation of your system.
